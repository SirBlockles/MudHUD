The DLL marked as r21 stable is the latest stable release from Pazer's fork of CE. The current CE DLL is CE-RED, a fork with additional features to bridge the gap since Pazer has kinda been on development hiatus.

Feel free to swap the DLLs, but also make sure to change the SpectatorTournament file to match, as there are some (very slight) changes.

TO USE CASTINGESSENTIALS, launch your game with the -insecure flag.
This will prevent you from connecting to VAC-secured servers, but playing back demos
and connecting to SourceTV (which doesn't use VAC) are completely fine.
