# MudHUD
Based on the old TeamFortressTV HUD (which was a fan recreation of the actual casting HUD). Some kind soul ported this to Blue Moon, but it was entirely broken and obviously untested.

I've taken it upon myself, someone who's never formally edited and maintained a HUD before, to edit and maintain this HUD.

Changes from the original port:
* HP and ammo numbers are now closer to the center of the screen, and have drop shadows to increase visibility.
* The main menu has been updated to work properly instead of being dummied out.
* The casual mode "team status" bar now has larger class portraits, player names, and overheal bar scale tweaking (a full 150% HP now has the overheal bar fully cover the health bar, rather than filling 50% extra of the bar).
* Stopwatch time, KOTH timers (+ "overtime" notices), and Arena player counts have all properly been integrated into the casual team status bar.
* Custom, larger control point icons, with custom renames of the Steel point icons because who even cares about the names Valve gave to those points?
* Tournament mode spectator HUD now properly spaces players, are a smidge wider, and can scale anywhere from Ultiduo to Highlander in player count.
* Closed Caption "box" is now properly placed into the HUD so that it doesn't collide with any HUD elements, for those who use captions in scripting or game info.
* Miscellaneous aesthetic tweaks (ie the health cross by the player's HP).
* Probably more that I can't remember.
