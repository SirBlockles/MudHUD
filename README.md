# MudHUD
Based on the teamfortress.tv fan-HUD, which was updated by @Hypnootize for Blue Moon, but soon to be with less clashing UI elements.

Planned UI fixes include:
* Closed Caption repositioning, so that CC don't have that stupid transparent box, and won't be in front of HP numbers.
* Repositioning of Arena Mode player count, so that it's not in front of the Casual Mode UI.
* Make the Casual UI icons a smidge bigger, and make the health bars' overheal go all the way through (like WietHUD - make 150% HP fill the entire overheal bar instead of half the health bar's total, for a more accurate read on overheal amount)
* Probably more UI positioning tweaking (health and ammo bars are a bit low it seems, and the medigun uber bar is nowhere near centered)
