# mudhud
There once was a HUD named TeamFortressTV HUD. It was a fan-made HUD, and I loved it a lot. I saw Hypnotize [update it](https://github.com/Hypnootize/TFTV-Hud), but back when I created mudhud it was broken. TFTV HUD has been fixed since, but by now I've changed so much about this HUD that it's become its own hud. Feedback I get on this HUD is either love or hate, never anywhere in between.

This is my first-ever HUD, and so some things will be pretty god-awful. And honestly I don't care.

This HUD is _only_ tested on 16:9 (1920x1080) in dx9. Since this is technically a personal HUD, I have little interest in upkeeping support for other resolutions, though I will probably get around to it eventually.

### Known problems:
The 3D Playermodel quite frequently covers up TargetIDs. Obviously I should reposition one of the two, but I don't really know which since I like them both where they are.

The countdown in Casual/Competitive modes look kinda stupid and have double countdowns. I don't have much opportunity to fix this since I can't figure out how to simluate the countdown without rejoining Casual over and over, and just forget it for Competitive.
